# "Rofi" is a dmenu replacement which palette uses in order to show the popup window
rofi:
  # There are two ways to format things:
  # 1) Both description and keybinding are aligned to the left:
  #       | Command Description [super+shift+c]            |
  # 2) Description aligned to the left, keybinding aligned to the right:
  #       | Command Description            [super+shift+c] |
  # If this field is set to `false`, the first option is used, otherwise we use the second option
  opposite_align_commands_and_shortcuts: false

  # The maximum number of chars which fit on a line in your Rofi theme.
  # Only needed if `opposite_align_commands_and_shortcuts` is set to `true`, 
  # but if it is then it is HIGHLY recommended you play around with this option until rofi looks nice.
  window_width: 91

  # Modifier Icons (EXPERIMENTAL)
  # You can set custom string to be swapped for "ctrl"/"super"/etc when the keybinding are shown in rofi.
  # This will only be done if `is_active` is `true`.
  modifier_icons:
    is_active: false
    ctrl: "\ufb33"
    shift: "\ufb35"
    super: "\ufb32"
    alt: "\ufb34"

  # In order to use some of Rofi's more advanced features, Palette uses a custom Rofi modi script.
  # Paletted generates the input for rofi and writes it to `input_path` before 
  mode_script:
    input_path: "/tmp/palette_rofi_script_input"

  # Pass additional command-line arguments directly to Rofi - use wisely.
  # By default this is empty, but heres a simple example for you which sets the theme to 'Arc':
  additional_arguments:
    - "-theme"
    - "Arc"
